## Retrieve

I love the funny things that I find on Imgur. I use Imgur exclusively though the mobile device, and I wanted a way to download the funny stuff I liked to my laptop.

So I created a new gmail account that I could share links to from within the app. The automator 'scrapes' my unread email bodies, looks for the imgur link, and opens the link in my browser. From there I can download it manually.

The next step is to fully automate the process where the automator downloads the image for me into my Pictures/hilaaaaarious folder. I could also expand this to support services other than imgur.
